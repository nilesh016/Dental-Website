            <h5>Teeth Whitening</h5>
            <p>Microscopic intrinsic stains and discolorations are present deep within the teeth, which give them an overall dull or yellowish appearance. Such stains are professionally removed by our whitening experts with the use of a peroxide based agent. The peroxide reacts with such stain producing substances thereby oxidizing and removing them completely. The gums and lips are protected with special barriers to prevent their contact with peroxide.</p>

            <h5>Missing Teeth</h5>
            <p>
               A missing tooth can certainly change the appearance of your smile.Regardless of the way a tooth is lost, it can negatively impact the alignment of your teeth over time and cause a number of problems down the road if it isn’t replaced. Sometimes the value of your teeth isn’t realized until they are lost, and unfortunately, teeth do not last forever. Even the loss of a single tooth can have a negative impact on your oral health and confidence. A missing tooth or teeth can also affect your speech, ability to chew your food, the integrity of your jawbone, and cause the slow shifting of your teeth into some of the empty spaces. Luckily, there are a number of excellent options available to replace your missing tooth or teeth to help restore your beautiful smiles.</p>

              <p>In a healthy mouth, over 700 different bacteria exist in balance. Some of these are beneficial, and others can be harmful. When bacteria grow out of control, they can pose problems for teeth, gums, and the rest of the mouth.
               If you don't keep up with oral hygiene or leave cavities or gingivitis untreated, this bacteria can start to affect the rest of the body, including the lungs and heart.</p>

              <p>In general terms, dentists recommend fluoride toothpaste for adults, as fluoride helps strengthen tooth enamel and prevent decay. For young children, who are prone to swallowing toothpaste, brushing haphazardly, and disliking strong, burning, mint flavors, there are specifically formulated children’s toothpastes.
               If you have sensitive teeth, you may require a toothpaste formulated to reduce sensitivity—though you should check with your dentist if you’re having sensitivity, as it might be a sign of a greater problem.</p>
